## Repository Details

Each file contains code for setting up, training, and evaluating various neural network models on specific datasets. These projects demonstrate techniques for tasks such as:

- Binary classification with ANNs.
- Customer churn prediction using deep learning models.
- Image classification with CNNs on popular datasets like CIFAR-10.
- Time-series prediction using LSTM-based RNNs.
- Feature extraction with autoencoders.

## Getting Started

To run any of these notebooks, ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. A typical environment setup may include the following packages:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `tensorflow` or `keras`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them with the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dhruva0101/NNDL-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder and open any Jupyter Notebook file:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook <notebook_name>.ipynb
   ```
3. Run each cell sequentially to train and evaluate the models.
